## Introduction

GeoFeatures is a full featured, lightweight, high performance geometry library for Objective-C.  It supports the full
 set of geometric primitives such as Point, Polygon, and LineString as well as collection classes such as MultiPoint, MultiPolygon,and MultiLineString.

## Features

- Easy to use.
- Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, Box and GeometryCollection implementations.
- Area, Length, BoundingBox, Centroid, Perimeter, Union, and Within (point in polygon) algorithms.  More coming soon.
- [WKT (Well-Known-Text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) input and output.
- [GeoJSON] (http://geojson.org/) input and output.
- MapKit representations and drawing.
- Open Sourced under the the [Apache License, Version 2.0] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
- Comprehensive doxygen documentation of the library available at [github.io] (http://tonystone.github.io/geofeatures).
- Implemented based on the popular and fast open source C++ boost geometry library.
